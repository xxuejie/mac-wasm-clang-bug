This repository documents wasm32-unknown-unknown target build build failure on macOS.

See [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xxuejie/mac-wasm-clang-bug.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xxuejie/mac-wasm-clang-bug) for detailed build information on each platform. As you can see, Linux works, while macOS would hit on different problems.

I've tried Googling this for a while but couldn't find any solution to this issue. Did anyone manage to get clang's wasm target working on macOS?

Thanks in advance for any help!
